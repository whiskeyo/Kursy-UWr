SRP says that one class (or module) should have just one responsibility. ISP says
that the user of the class (or module) should not be weigh down by calling methods
or creating classes that they do not need. 

As an example, take Console.WriteLine:
    * we do not need to create any object in order to call it
    * we do not have to specify e.g. object of Font with its size

The role of ISP is splitting big interfaces to many smallers, more specific ones.
Thanks to it, user needs to know only these methods that are important to him. It
may sound similar to SRP, but roles of ISP and SRP are quite different:
    * SRP is focused on projecting data of classes and modules
    * ISP is focused on the usage of classes and modules.
